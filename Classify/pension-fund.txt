BEIJING - China's pension fund is probably to be allowed to invest into the stock market to keep value and improve management as the country faces the challenge of an aging population.

An official draft guideline released on Monday gives the fund the greenlight to invest in the stock market but restricts the maximum proportion of investment in stocks and equities to 30 percent of total net assets.

The move is to improve investment management and supervision of the social security fund and diversify investment channels, said a statement from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MHRSS) and Ministry of Finance.

In China, urban employees pay for their pension before retirement and usually get a pension equal to about half of their previous salary. Outstanding contributions to the fund stood at 3.06 trillion yuan (around $500 billion) at the end of 2014.
